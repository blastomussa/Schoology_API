# Schoology_API

Python implementation of the Schoology API. Uses two-legged Oauth1.0 for authorization so it is best used in server-to-server applications. api_requests.py handles the authorization and REST API methods and can be used to make raw api calls. To connect to API save API secret and key in config.ini.
